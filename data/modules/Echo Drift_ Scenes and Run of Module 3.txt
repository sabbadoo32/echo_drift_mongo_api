Echo Drift: Scenes and Run of Module 3

 "Gracefall" (The Gunner's Loop)
🎮 Format: Tactical Subspace Escape Thriller
🎭 Tone: Submarine warfare meets psychological drift collapse
⏱ Timeline: Occurs in 10 tactical turns with dynamic time-ahead mechanic
==================================================
📍 SETTING:
* Location: Subspace drift corridor near Kalaris Belt
* Starting State: Tazk aboard the prototype vessel Grace, 4 minutes ahead of Ophelia’s intercept AI
* Objective: Reach the wormhole before Ophelia locks the vessel's coordinates
==================================================
🎬 SCENE STRUCTURE (RUN OF MODULE)
🔸 TURN 1: “Launch Pattern”
* Choose route: Chronosec Intercept Path / Smuggler’s Drift / Hidden Tunnel
* Diagnostics: Sensor pings, nav-map alignment
* Echo Drift Event: Autopilot flicker (course correction or Echo override)
* Time Update: Player sees starting +4 minutes buffer

🔸 TURN 2: “Silent Run”
* Action: Enable/disable Grace’s heat signature and comms
* Threat: AI trace attempt
* Skill: Pilot + Electronics
* Echo Drift: Flash of Bravo Battery voice; disorients nav display
* Outcome: Stealth bonus or internal glitch

🔸 TURN 3: “Ghost Ping”
* Use: Decoy beacon or noise trap
* Risk: Detection vs damage tradeoff
* Drift: Reflection of Tazk in viewport doesn’t sync

🔸 TURN 4: “Course Divergence”
* Branches: Commit to route path / reroute at risk
* Bonus: Learn from smuggler nav signature
* Echo Drift: Hallucinated broadcast from lost crewmember

🔸 TURN 5: “Dead Interval”
* Time Check: Countdown status revealed
* Threat: Radiation spike or hull stress
* Decision: Hold course vs emergency realign
* Echo Drift: Mirror corridor manifests within Grace

🔸 TURN 6: “Ophelia Proximity”
* Event: First voice message from OPHELIA AI
* Action: Ignore, spoof, or respond
* Echo Drift: Time lag in speech response
* Time Cost: Actions here influence trace speed

🔸 TURN 7: “The Drift Knife”
* Use of FIM or similar device to cut Echo link
* Choice: Self-harm to block Drift channel or allow ghost fusion
* Risk: Psychological damage vs stealth gain

🔸 TURN 8: “Interference Bloom”
* EM storm in corridor disrupts nav
* Requires: Vacc Suit skill to rewire access node manually
* Drift: Crew ghost walks down hallway and vanishes

🔸 TURN 9: “Lock or Let Go”
* Countdown report: Remaining time exposed
* Final Echo: Image of sailor who died in Mod 1 seen aboard
* System Decision: Enable jump nav or trigger internal sabotage

FIXED POINT - MANDATORY CINEMATIC: DO NOT SKIP OR MODIFY
🔸 TURN 10: “Jump Window”
* Wormhole opens
* Jump Attempt: Based on time left and drift stability
* Drift Collapse: Tazk sees all of Bravo Battery at stations
* Ending Branch:
   * Clean Jump: If >1 min remains
   * Under Fire: 0.1–0.9 min
   * Intercept: ≤0 min = Lock-on
==================================================
🎯 MECHANICS OVERVIEW
* Echo Drifts occur each turn, escalating in intensity
* Time-Ahead starts at +4 minutes
* Countdown revealed at Turns 1, 5, 9
* Decisions affect time delta, OPHELIA response, Drift influence
