TuxedoMan Arc — The Evaluator’s Chair
Scenes and Run of Module 2 — “The Spy, the Favor, the World Once Freed”

🎬 Opening Cinematic — “Demonstration and Return”
INT: ARCHIVAL ROOM — ABANDONED STATION (FLASHBACK)

Footage replays of TuxedoMan demonstrating how his interdimensional escape system works. It overlays charts showing the masking of dimensional transfers via cosmic background noise. A quiet, early morning on a new world fades in—the Spy walks through misty soil once sterilized by AGI strikes, now alive again. He breathes. TuxedoMan’s voice echoes:
“History won’t remember this world. But you will. When I call, you’ll answer.”

CUT TO: PRESENT DAY — The Spy receives the signal.

📅 Run of Module — Phase & Scene Flow

SCENE 1: “Debt of Silence” — Spy Recruits His Allies
Framing: The Spy activates old favors: former Algol officers, dissenting engineers, compromised diplomats.

NPCs Introduced:
- Erin Valcoris – Disgraced diplomatic architect hiding on Mirax-Sel. She holds the emitter encryption key theory.
- Kull Draan – Rogue engineer with access to phase-scan tools. Stationed aboard a junkbarge orbiting a dead satellite.

Goal: Uncover location of the disguised emitter feeding the Sensor Planet.
Skill Gates: Streetwise, Persuade, Electronics, Science
Echo Outcomes:
- Deep Tap (3+ successes): Precise location & unguarded path
- Fractured Web (2): Intel gained, some security still active
- Leaky Source (≤1): Enemy alerted; security hardens

SCENE 2: “Relay Grave” — Infiltrate the Emitter
Framing: A ruined comms array hidden in a dead zone of orbital static.
Goal: Breach emitter disguised as a decaying relay; plant disruptor beacon.
Skill Gates: Stealth, Mechanic, Explosives, Tactics
Fixed Point: Radiation field disables conventional scans.
Echo Outcomes:
- Clean Sever: Emitter destroyed, no signal
- Blowback: Partial detonation; masked pulse leaks
- Burn Mark: Enemy senses disruption, prepares counterforce

SCENE 3: “Foxtrot Black” — Tazk’s Fleet Intercept
Framing: Tazk leads an ECM frigate, Marine transport, and strike squadrons to intercept a rogue Algol battle group approaching the Sensor World.

NPCs Introduced:
- Major Cas Virell – Commander of Blackshade Company, leads the Marine boarding team.
- Commander Ayel Thorn – ECM specialist aboard the CNS Jade Hollow, in charge of comm-jamming and signal masking.

Skill Gates: Leadership, Gunnery, Pilot, Tactics
Phases:
- Dogfights (use Foxbat mechanics)
- Frigate ECM duel
- Marine boarding (optional)
Echo Outcomes:
- Flawless Break: Enemy broken before comms transmit
- Forced Breach: Comm-link severed just before transmission
- Late Cut: Partial broadcast; alert spreads

SCENE 4: “Link-Up” — Spy & Tazk Teams Merge
Framing: A field handover under aurora-glow; fading radiation trails from the emitter site.
Objective: Share intel, finalize shield-collapse window.
Echo Outcomes:
- Tuned Sequence: −50% shield achievable
- Scrambled: −30%
- Overheard: Algol taps into the handoff

SCENE 5: “Descent in Fire” — Asteroid Strike & Collapse
Fixed Sequence:
- Countdown active (<1 hour)
- Planet begins destabilization
- Final transmissions from allies ring out

Echo Cues:
- “We’re burning but holding the line!”
- “Field collapsing. We’re through!”
- “No time—jump now!”

Impact Outcome Tags:
- Planet Vaporized (Surgical Success): Clean blackout of the sensor grid
- Orbital Spill (Partial): AGI detection staggered but partial system persists
- Dimensional Bleed (Failure): Echo Drift ripples trigger prematurely

🎯 End State (Module 2)
- Sensor Planet shield fully compromised
- Radiation emitter gone
- Spy’s debt fulfilled
- Tazk now Echo-tagged with “Multi-Theater Command”
- Algol’s perception fractures—opening Module 3

Recorded Echo Tags:
- Spy Network: Deep Tap / Fractured Web / Leaky Source
- Emitter Breach: Clean Sever / Blowback / Burn Mark
- Fleet Intercept: Flawless / Forced / Late Cut
- Final Handoff: Tuned / Scrambled / Overheard
- Strike Result: Vaporized / Spill / Bleed
