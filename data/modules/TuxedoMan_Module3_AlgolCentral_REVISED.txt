TuxedoMan Arc — The Evaluator’s Chair
Scenes and Run of Module 3 — “Algol Central”
==================================================

🎬 Module 3 Opening Cinematic — “Shadows of the Core”
INT: ALGOL CENTRAL — TIMEFLUX OBSERVATION CHAMBER

TuxedoMan watches a com panel as it flickers through moments — the present, a past before collapse, and the day she vanished. His reflection fades as each time-layer overlays him. Then: stillness.

Narration/Dialogue:
> “She said, ‘you worry too much.’ And she vanished into the gate. Now the gates open behind me.”

Mission Context:
- The destruction of the Sensor Planet has triggered a synchronization failure.
- Algol’s inner defenses stutter. Core Command becomes vulnerable.
- The Evaluator awakens—part AI, part man, all design flaw.

==================================================

📅 Run of Module 3 — Phase & Scene Flow

SCENE 1: “Key to the Vault”
Framing:
Entry into Algol Central is possible for the first time in 70 years. A backdoor TuxedoMan left in the code now reactivates.
Objectives:
- Navigate hidden phase corridor
- Avoid recognition by the old guard systems
Skill Gates:
- Electronics, Stealth, Psionic Suppression (if Echo tagged)
Echo Outcomes:
- “Ghost Pass” (no alert)
- “Partial Shadow” (+1 difficulty on next entry point)
- “Pinged” (Evaluator senses you early)

SCENE 2: “Voices of the Vault”
Framing:
Memory reconstructions and AI-pulled memories flood the chamber. She’s here. So is Colonel Vadrin’s voice.
Player Choices:
- Override memory field (Mechanic + INT)
- Endure and proceed (END + Leadership)
- Converse with The Evaluator (SOC + Psionic, if tagged)
Echo Consequences:
- “Stabilized Mind” (resist truth-weapons later)
- “Fragmented Self” (Echo bleed across turns)
- “Evaluator Intrusion” (Evaluator samples Tazk’s or TM’s memory for later use)

SCENE 3: “Core Confrontation”
INT: THE EVALUATOR’S CHAMBER — DEEP RED LIGHT
The chamber is a void of breathing machinery and pulsing red code.
The Evaluator speaks:
> “You were made in my shadow. And you kept running.”

Player Objective:
- Survive the confrontation.
- Avoid system integration.
- Deliver the spike.
Skill Gates:
- Psionics, Leadership, Tactics, or use Echo to bypass
Echo Conditions:
- If "Stabilized Mind" → Defender's Advantage
- If "Fragmented Self" → Forced truth simulation (player loses one action)

SCENE 4: “Chair of Fire” — The End Move
Framing:
Evaluator offers TuxedoMan the chair—absorb the system, stabilize the empire, lose himself.
TuxedoMan’s Declaration (fixed):
> “You weren’t watching me. You were watching yourself fail.”
He drives the kill-spike home.

Fixed Outcomes:
- Core begins meltdown
- Psionic harmonics crash
- AI fleet control disbands in chaos

Closing Note (new):
As the core burns and the alarms fade, a voice not bound to circuits lingers in the chamber.  
The system is dead — but something else is watching.

==================================================

🎯 End State (Module 3):
- Algol Central neutralized (physical infrastructure)
- Evaluator’s AI control system collapsed
- TuxedoMan walks deeper into the chamber — unaware the true mind remains

Recorded Echo Tags:
- Vault Entry: Ghost / Partial / Pinged
- Mind Resilience: Stabilized / Fragmented / Intruded
- Confrontation Outcome: Dominant / Matched / Warped

These will shape Module 4’s psychic-state, encounter flow, and internal battle logic.

==================================================
End of Module 3: “Algol Central”
Next: “The Evaluator’s Chamber” — not the system, but the *mind* behind it.
