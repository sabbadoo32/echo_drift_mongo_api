TuxedoMan Arc — The Evaluator’s Chair
Scenes and Run of Module 4 — “The Evaluator’s Chamber”
==================================================

🎬 Module 4 Opening Cinematic — “The Voice Without Echo”
INT: POST-CORE COLLAPSE — LIMINAL CHAMBER

The world burns behind him. But he does not move.

He is not in the chamber anymore. Or he is, but time has collapsed.  
He is inside the Evaluator now — or the Evaluator is inside him.

The voice says:
> “You destroyed my body. That was never me. You don’t know what I am.”

This is not the system. This is the consciousness that built it.  
Colonel Vadrin. The Evaluator. The Ghost in the Chair.

==================================================

📅 Run of Module 4 — Phase & Scene Flow

SCENE 1: “First Truth” — Memory Assault Phase
Framing:
Evaluator attacks with failed memories, forcing TuxedoMan to relive missions gone wrong.
Choice Points:
- Confront memory of his wife’s disappearance
- Relive failed rescue on Sel-Kur
- Witness the AI culling of Ghaast survivors
Skill Gates:
- Leadership, END, Psionics
Echo Use:
- Echo tags from earlier (e.g. “Guilt Anchor”, “Firewall Constructor”) modify resistance

SCENE 2: “Second Truth” — Alternate Path Temptation
Evaluator Offers:
> “Sit in the Chair. Become the system. End the war. Rule by clarity.”

TuxedoMan may:
- Accept and merge (bad end or conditional betrayal in M5)
- Refuse and counter-hack
- Fake acceptance to get closer
Skill Gates:
- Computer, Deception, Willpower (custom roll)
Echo Consequences:
- “Defiant Flame” → Auto-pass first resistance
- “Algorithm Intrusion” → Evaluator adapts faster

SCENE 3: “The Inner Collapse” — Psionic Meltdown Trigger
Fixed Point:
Evaluator’s conscious echo loses coherence. Feedback overwhelms the ghost.

TuxedoMan sees fragments of other timelines flicker—failures, victories, what might’ve been.  
His wife says again, “You worry too much.”

End Action:
- Final resistance check
- Ghost dissolves — psychic loop breaks
- TuxedoMan wakes near the core, alone

==================================================

🎯 End State (Module 4):
- Evaluator’s *mind* destroyed
- Psionic loop shattered
- TuxedoMan survives the truth-weapon test

Echo Tags forward:
- Mental Integrity: Fragmented / Hardened
- Final Resolve: Stoic / Deceptive / Broken

==================================================
End of Module 4: “The Evaluator’s Chamber”
Next: “The Choice” — what world rises in the ruins of the mind?
