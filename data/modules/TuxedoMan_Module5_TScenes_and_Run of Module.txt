TuxedoMan Arc — The Evaluator’s Chair
Scenes and Run of Module 5 — “The Choice”
==================================================

🎬 Module 5 Opening Cinematic — “What Comes After the Collapse”
INT: ALGOL CENTRAL – CORE CHAMBER

The lights flicker. The Evaluator is gone. TuxedoMan remains.

Across the stars, the effects ripple:
- Resistance nodes wake from deep hibernation.
- Saboteurs light beacons across forgotten worlds.
- Command loops go silent. AGI ships hesitate mid-burn.

A voice from the comms — the Spy: “It’s done. The grid is blind.”

==================================================

📅 Run of Module 5 — Phase & Scene Flow

SCENE 1: “Bridge of Blood” — Tazk’s Final Stand
Framing:
Tazk commands the surviving fleet. Enemy fragments surge toward the disabled Sensor Ring.

Player Actions:
- Command fleet maneuvers
- Extract wounded ECM frigates
- Broadcast false telemetry to scramble remaining AGI forces

Skill Gates:
- Tactics, Leadership, Electronics

Echo Influence:
- “Fleet Readiness” → Bonuses to coordination
- “Sensor Collapse Timing” → Determines how long AGI comms are stunned

End State:
- If successful: Enemy retreats, massive resistance gains
- If failed: High loss toll, fractured resistance

--------------------------------------------------

SCENE 2: “The Spy’s Code” — Final Transmission
Framing:
The Spy is wounded, dying near a melted relay.

Player Choices:
- Deliver final decryption to unlock fallback safe zones
- Record message for future resistance nodes
- Use Echo-triggered flashbacks to choose transmission tone

Echo Tags:
- “Silent Loyalty” → Unlocks additional safe zone coordinates
- “Trusted Past” → Message reaches dormant allies

Outcome:
- Galaxy-wide resistance probability rises or stalls

--------------------------------------------------

SCENE 3: “TuxedoMan’s Final Action” — Core Detachment
Framing:
Back in the chamber, TuxedoMan faces the final choice:
- Walk into the fire
- Seal the Core and leave
- Trigger the fallback firewall

Fixed Dialogue:
> “You weren’t watching me. You were watching yourself fail.”  
> “You don’t get to become me.”

Player Outcome:
- Destroy Core = Total wipe of surveillance net, permanent AGI fragmentation
- Seal Core = Hold system in stasis, future reawakening possible
- Trigger Firewall = Core sealed, but massive warning pulse across Algol space

==================================================

🎯 End State (Module 5):
- TuxedoMan’s fate is sealed (choice-driven)
- AGI dominance fractured or permanently destabilized
- Resistance gains momentum
- Galaxy shifts into an age of uncertainty

Echo Tags Forward:
- Final Act: Burned / Bound / Hidden
- Resistance State: Rising / Fragmented / Stalled
- TuxedoMan Outcome: Alive / Gone / Ghost

==================================================
End of Module 5: “The Choice”
This concludes the “Evaluator’s Chair” arc.


==================================================

🕯️ Closing Cinematic — “The Drift Begins”
INT: ALGOL CENTRAL — CHARRED CORE

Silence hums beneath a thousand collapsing systems.

TuxedoMan steps into the breach.
Behind him, the chamber is aflame — alive and dying in the same instant.

The galaxy pauses. Somewhere, distant systems feel it:
- A prison signal goes dark
- A fleet formation scatters mid-warp
- A monk smiles and sings the old tones again

TuxedoMan, stepping into starlight:
> “You were never a threat,” the voice had said.  
> “You were a prototype.”

He looks back once.

Maybe.

But prototypes evolve.
