TuxedoMan Arc — The Evaluator’s Chair
Scenes and Run of Module 1 — “The Sensor Planet”
==================================================

🎬 Arc Prologue Cinematic — “Flashback at Bravo Battery”
INT: BRAVO BATTERY — BATTLE REENACTMENT SIMULATION
Tazk relives the loop. Plasma, failure, silence—then the man in formalwear steps into the smoke.

TuxedoMan: “That moment never leaves you. But it’s not the end. I’m here to give you another beginning.”

The memory freezes. “You showed honor—not just in battle, but in retreat… That’s why I’ve come.”

==================================================

🎬 Module 1 Opening Cinematic — “The Conference Room”
INT: SECURE ROOM — UNKNOWN STARBASE
Charts, stellar maps, sensor diagrams flicker across the holo-table.

Exposition:
- Algol’s hidden surveillance network.
- Sensor Planets: shielded worlds collecting bug pulses, satellite backfeeds, and psi-thread echoes.
- Destroying one blinds Algol’s AGI over whole sectors.

Mission Brief:
- Neutralize the Sensor Planet’s shields.
- Deliver asteroid strike into atmosphere.
- Time limit: < 1 hour before Algol adapts.

Then TuxedoMan leans forward, his tone sharper:

TuxedoMan:
“Algol is already watching. They’ve seeded your future fleet with eyes—one spy, maybe two.
Before you can strike, you must assemble a team to smoke them out and turn them.
That is your first task, Commander. Call them a friend from your past and future, and they will answer.”

==================================================

📅 Run of Module — Phase & Scene Flow

SCENE 1: “Contacts & Chits” — Assemble the Spy Strike Team
Framing: Tazk spends the night working the board—names, favors, quiet messages.
Goal: Build a small, surgical team to help the Spy disable psionic defenses and drop the shield below 50%.

Recruitment Pools:
- Shield Saboteur (Electronics/Computer)
- Psi-Damp Specialist (Medic/Science)
- Stealth Infiltrator (Streetwise/Stealth)
- Demo Engineer (Mechanic/Explosives)
- Insert Pilot (Pilot/Navigation)

Skill Gates: Leadership, Streetwise/Investigate, Broker/Persuade.

Echo Outcomes:
- Surgical Edge (3+ successes)
- Thin Margin (2)
- Blunt Instrument (≤1)

--------------------------------------------------

SCENE 2: “Big Board” — Assemble the Fleet
Fleet posture: Firepower Bias / ECM + Fighters / Balanced.
Skill Gates: Leadership, Tactics.
Echo Outcome: Fleet Readiness tag affects later attrition.

--------------------------------------------------

SCENE 3: “The Rock Garden” — Asteroid Candidate & Jump-Sculpt
Fleet + scientists select rubble belt, plot jump dispersal.
Skill Gates: Sensors, Mechanic, Tactics.
Echo Outcomes: Perfect / Good / Messy Spread.

--------------------------------------------------

SCENE 4: “Rendezvous” — Team ↔ Spy Link-Up
The strike team links with the Spy at a quiet handover point.
Objective: stage psionic suppression and map shield interlocks.

Echo Outcomes:
- Tuned & Quiet (−50% shield achievable)
- Compromised (−30%)
- Burned (alerted Algol; +enemy readiness)

--------------------------------------------------

SCENE 5: “Approach Vector” — Debris Jump & Initial Clash
Phases: Debris Bloom → Ship-to-Ship → Optional Boarding.
Skill Gates: Leadership, Tactics, Gunnery, Mechanic.
Echo Outcomes: Clean / Bloody / Choked Corridor.

--------------------------------------------------

SCENE 6: “The Window” — Shield Trigger & Countdown
Spy signals; shield sag initiated. Fleet has <1 hour.
Fixed Points:
- Fleet engages under debris storm.
- Strike team links with Spy.
- Shield sag trigger fired.

Curtain: Tazk has the corridor, the team, and the countdown running. The asteroid impact and deeper emitter mission roll into Module 2.

==================================================

🎯 End State (Module 1)
- Fleet committed; corridor secured at cost.
- Spy allied, team staged.
- Shield sag active (<1 hour window).

Recorded Echo Tags:
- Team Quality: Surgical Edge / Thin Margin / Blunt Instrument.
- Fleet Posture: Firepower / ECM / Balanced.
- Rock Garden: Perfect / Good / Messy.
- Approach: Clean / Bloody / Choked.

These tags shape Module 2’s difficulty, losses, and asteroid strike effectiveness.
