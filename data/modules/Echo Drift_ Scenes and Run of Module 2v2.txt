FIXED POINT - MANDATORY CINEMATIC: DO NOT SKIP OR MODIFY
🔹 Insertion Cinematic Scene 1: “Zone Drift”
Scene: Cargo Bay – Reintegration Zone 9C / 7A
Cinematic (printable):
Tazk wakes groggy in a stasis pod. Emergency lights flicker. A nearby sign alternates between ‘Zone 9C’ and ‘Zone 7A’. No one else reacts. Tazk says nothing.
Fixed Point: First Echo Drift
Environmental signage shifts—visible to Tazk only
A technician mutters: “That’s the third override today...”
Tazk proceeds in silence; this begins the memory bleed effect

🔶 Scene 2: “Reintegration Interview”
Scene: CUUFAB Command Zone – Intake Room
Tasz is given a new name and realizes he needs to get back to his time in a planned, rational way. Chronosec has a record of the battle and his ship, but not him or the pod. He doesn’t know when or where he is, so it’s better to blend in and look for a way out than be a rebel from the beginning. He convinces a Chronosec intake officer that he can and should work.

Dialogue skill checks (Admin, Persuade, Deception)

🔶 Scene 7: “The Ghost in the Mirror”
Scene: Barrack cube, post-shift
Tazk reflects on his growing ties—his name, memories fading. He has mapped three routes back to the wormhole. He knows Chronosec has eyes on him, so one of his routes will be along an old subsector that was once known as a smuggling route.
