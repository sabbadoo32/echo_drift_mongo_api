His reflection fades as each time-layer overlays him. Then: stillness.\n\nNarration/Dialogue:\n> \u201cShe said, \u2018you worry too much.\u2019 And she vanished into the gate. Now the gates open behind me.\u201d\n\nMission Context:\n- The destruction of the Sensor Planet has triggered a synchronization failure.\n- Algol\u2019s inner defenses stutter. Core Command becomes vulnerable.\n- The Evaluator awakens\u2014part AI, part man, all design flaw.\n\n==================================================\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Run of Module 3 \u2014 Phase & Scene Flow\n\nSCENE 1: \u201cKey to the Vault\u201d\nFraming:\nEntry into Algol Central is possible for the first time in 70 years.

She\u2019s here. So is Colonel Vadrin\u2019s voice.\nPlayer Choices:\n- Override memory field (Mechanic + INT)\n- Endure and proceed (END + Leadership)\n- Converse with The Evaluator (SOC + Psionic, if tagged)\nEcho Consequences:\n- \u201cStabilized Mind\u201d (resist truth-weapons later)\n- \u201cFragmented Self\u201d (Echo bleed across turns)\n- \u201cEvaluator Intrusion\u201d (Evaluator samples Tazk\u2019s or TM\u2019s memory for later use)\n\nSCENE 3: \u201cCore Confrontation\u201d\nINT: THE EVALUATOR\u2019S CHAMBER \u2014 DEEP RED LIGHT\nThe chamber is a void of breathing machinery and pulsing red code.\nThe Evaluator speaks:\n> \u201cYou were made in my shadow. And you kept running.\u201d\n\nPlayer Objective:\n- Survive the confrontation.\n- Avoid system integration.\n- Deliver the spike.\nSkill Gates:\n- Psionics, Leadership, Tactics, or use Echo to bypass\nEcho Conditions:\n- If \"Stabilized Mind\" \u2192 Defender's Advantage\n- If \"Fragmented Self\" \u2192 Forced truth simulation (player loses one action)\n\nSCENE 4: \u201cChair of Fire\u201d \u2014 The End Move\nFraming:\nEvaluator offers TuxedoMan the chair\u2014absorb the system, stabilize the empire, lose himself.\nTuxedoMan\u2019s Declaration (fixed):\n> \u201cYou weren\u2019t watching me. You were watching yourself fail.\u201d\nHe drives the kill-spike home.\n\nFixed Outcomes:\n- Core begins meltdown\n- Psionic harmonics crash\n- AI fleet control disbands in chaos\n\nClosing Note (new):\nAs the core burns and the alarms fade, a voice not bound to circuits lingers in the chamber.  \nThe system is dead \u2014 but something else is watching.\n\n==================================================\n\n\ud83c\udfaf End State (Module 3):\n- Algol Central neutralized (physical infrastructure)\n- Evaluator\u2019s AI control system collapsed\n- TuxedoMan walks deeper into the chamber \u2014 unaware the true mind remains\n\nRecorded Echo Tags:\n- Vault Entry: Ghost / Partial / Pinged\n- Mind Resilience: Stabilized / Fragmented / Intruded\n- Confrontation Outcome: Dominant / Matched / Warped\n\nThese will shape Module 4\u2019s psychic-state, encounter flow, and internal battle logic.\n\n==================================================\nEnd of Module 3: \u201cAlgol Central\u201d\nNext: \u201cThe Evaluator\u2019s Chamber\u201d \u2014 not the system, but the *mind* behind it.\n"
