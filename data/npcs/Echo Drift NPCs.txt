SUPPORTING CHARACTER: DREN VALLAS
Role: Disgraced Chronosec Engineer / Off-grid Technician
Location: Site Theta-14, Mavros-V
Age: Late 40s
Appearance: Pale skin splotched with radiation freckles, cracked goggles always hanging around his neck, perpetual smell of ionized metal.
Status: Field tech contractor, technically cleared—socially avoided.
________________


🧩 BACKSTORY & FUNCTION:
   * Once led a retro-tech research unit at a blacksite lab called “Fathom-6”, decommissioned after a containment breach during a wormhole stability experiment.
   * Now works salvage on Mavros under tight leash. No one trusts him, but no one knows analog systems like he does.
   * Thinks modern ship systems are a trap—and speaks in riddles, metaphors, and half-wired logic.

🎬 FIRST INTERACTION SCENE
Location: Wreck under Theta-14, Fused Deck Tunnel
Tazk finds Vallas wrist-deep in fried cabling inside a hull bloom.
A soft whine buzzes around him—unstable power, but rhythmic. Almost musical.
DREN VALLAS (without turning):
“You hear it? The pulse? That’s not a capacitor hum. That’s residual field longing. Old tech remembers movement... even through time.”
Tazk steps in.
Tazk:
“Looking for nav-core backups. Anything older than 6th gen.”
VALLAS (still fiddling):
“You’re looking for something else. Aren’t we all? There’s a Dart-class wreck beneath Subshell 4. Fathom-6 buried it quiet—wasn’t supposed to fly. But it did. And it came back twitching.”
Tazk (measured):
“And the FIM?”
VALLAS (pauses):
“You want one that isn’t networked. One that doesn’t care what year it is.”
He finally looks up, eyes glowing behind cracked lenses.
VALLAS (whispers):
“Careful. That kind of tech... it doesn’t just stabilize. It remembers.”

Would you like this interaction to trigger a minor skill check or tracking mission (e.g. Sensors or Recon to reach Subshell 4), or have Vallas demand a favor in exchange for coordinates?
You said:
Something casual, I don't want this guy to be a threat. Maybe he demands the same treat or piece of info, or something that's important to him but not to the story.
ChatGPT said:
Got it. We’ll make Dren Vallas eccentric but harmless—a quirky relic-hound with no agenda beyond his little comforts. His help comes at the price of a ritualized trade, something small that means everything to him and nothing to the mission.

🎬 Updated Scene: Casual Bargain with Vallas
Location: Theta-14 Wreck Cluster, Subhull Vent Stack
Sound: Electrostatic chatter, sand hissing over metal
Tazk climbs into a semi-pressurized hull space. Faint glow of a repair torch flickers below. He finds Vallas kneeling by a rust-stained junction board, splicing wire by feel.
DREN VALLAS:
“Don’t touch the orange conduit. It hums like it wants to be touched—but it bites.”
Tazk steps over a cracked frame. Sits on a crate.
TAZK:
“You mentioned a Dart-class. Said it came back.”
VALLAS:
“Came back wrong. But whole. Mostly. Has the box you’re hunting.”
(He squints)
“Field Integrity Modulator, right? You want the kind that doesn’t speak code. One that just listens.”
Tazk waits.
VALLAS (leans in conspiratorially):
“I’ll give you the map to Subshell 4. But you gotta bring me one thing.”
TAZK:
“What is it?”
VALLAS:
“Vanta gum. The kind they stopped making two years ago. Black foil. Smells like burnt stars.”
Tazk stares. Deadpan.
VALLAS (grinning):
“I chew it when I map drift echoes. Helps me focus.”
________________


🪙 Quest Item: Vanta Gum Pack
   * Found at the Mavros-V supply kiosk or stashed in a transport locker.
   * Optional: Can make it a minor scavenging side loop.
   * Doesn’t impact the narrative—but gives the world flavor and makes Vallas more real.
Would you like to continue with:
   * Tazk retrieving the gum (brief downtime beat)
   * Vallas giving him the data map to Subshell 4
   * Or an encounter en route to Subshell 4 (like ambient Echo flicker)?
You said:
perfect. We can come back to this guy in this mod and the final one, if necessary.
ChatGPT said:
Locked: Dren Vallas is now an anchored side character—eccentric, nonthreatening, valuable, and revisitable in both this module and the finale. He’s your analog bridge to ancient tech and old truths.

SUPPORTING CHARACTER: Sergeant Mel Cray
Role: Former Chronosec Forward Security
Current Position: Mavros-V landing support / ship ID clerk
Appearance: Worn flight suit, prosthetic leg, half-vaped voice, carries a sidearm but never turns it on
Reputation: Respected but volatile. Says what others won’t. Still reads threat surfaces like field data.
________________


🧩 FUNCTION IN STORY
   * Knows too much about ship disappearance protocols.
   * Carries guilt over a mission lost to Echo Drift—won’t talk about it unless provoked.
   * Recognizes Tazk as “one of the last turret ghosts.” Doesn’t fully trust him.
   * Sees Chronosec’s deeper intention forming again—and warns Tazk subtly.

🎬 SCENE: Registry Queue – Echo Between Lines
Location: Mavros-V Dock Hub 3
Sound: Hum of registry drones, rustle of forms, distant shuttle ignition
Tazk approaches the terminal for outbound cargo manifest edits. Cray is behind the console, bored, scanning IFF tags with one eye and the horizon with the other.
CRAY (monotone):
"Name, sector, purpose."
TAZK:
"Tazk. Theta-14. Nav-core reclamation."
Cray pauses. Taps twice. Her screen flickers.
CRAY:
"You know what nav-cores bleed when you dig too deep?"
Tazk stays silent.
CRAY (leans in):
"Time. Not data. Not fuel. Not noise. Time. Ships that see too far into it? They come back folded. You trackin' me?"
Tazk gives a neutral nod.
CRAY (lowers voice):
"You wanna disappear? That’s your business. But if you’re thinking about coming back through something you’re not supposed to... make peace with what won’t follow you."
She stamps the manifest. Holds it a second too long before handing it over.
________________


Cray functions as a living warning—someone who's seen the consequences of temporal instability firsthand.
Would you like to embed her in a second encounter later in the module (e.g., when Tazk is caught between escape or deeper involvement), or keep her at this single poignant crossroad?
You said:
lets bring her back. she could be a story fork
ChatGPT said:
Excellent choice. Sergeant Cray will now serve as a story fork node—a grounded, consequence-aware NPC who can return in:
   * A late-module confrontation, where she tries to warn or stop Tazk from stealing or activating the FIM ship
   * The final module, where she may appear as either:
   * A reluctant ally (if trust is built), or
   * A Chronosec recall agent (if burned)

🔄 FORK LOGIC (Behind-the-Scenes Mechanics)
   * Early Trust Signal (now): Neutral tone, vague warning
   * Optional Mid-Module Checkpoint: If Tazk confides in her or helps her (e.g., recovers her missing prosthetic part or ship log), she becomes a conditional ally
   * If Ignored or Lied To: She tips off Chronosec later—subtle or overt, depending on escalation
