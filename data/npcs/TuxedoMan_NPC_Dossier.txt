BACKSTORY (Summarized)
-----------------------
Once an Algol systems engineer and AI-integrated researcher, TuxedoMan diverged after a personal tragedy involving a failed time-travel experiment that claimed his wife. Disillusioned by over-automated futures, he shifted toward dimensional migration—offering quiet escapes to systems on the brink.

He operates solo but is never alone. His mythos forms from the aftermath of his interventions. He does not recruit. He opens doors.
