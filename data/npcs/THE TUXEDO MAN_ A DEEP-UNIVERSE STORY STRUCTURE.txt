THE TUXEDO MAN: A DEEP-UNIVERSE STORY STRUCTURE
This is a history of the Tuxedo Man and how he fits as a hidden post-arc storyline.
________________


I. CORE PREMISE
The Tuxedo Man is not a myth, not a messiah, and not a martyr. He is a credible, pragmatic figure who discovered time travel first and then interdimensional travel. He is Algol, an ancient race that embraces AI as endemic to life. The Tuxedo Man believes otherwise. He operates in a universe stretched thin by overgrowth, automation, and rising complexity. The systems aren’t collapsing, but they are increasingly brittle. Some people see what’s coming, and when the Tuxedo Man quietly offers a way out, they take it.
His interdimensional project is not ideological. It is practical. He offers systems a jump to a new universe—not a paradise, but a viable space where people can build without being crushed by legacy systems, dead laws, or AI-mediated stagnation. He is not hiding; he is just very busy.

II. TECH FOUNDATIONS AND FAILURES
A. Time Travel (Initial Discovery)
* The Algol discovered first, considered incredibly dangerous.
* While making progress on stabilizing it, time travel became responsible for the loss of TuxedoMans wife during an experiment.
* He refuses to use it further, though he still understands its mechanisms.
* Time travel revealed the existence of dimensional variance and inspired the shift to interdimensional escape.
B. Interdimensional Travel (The Real Breakthrough)
* TuxedoMan eventually discovers stable transdimensional pathways.
* Begins establishing automated reception systems on new worlds.
* These systems are designed to self-construct and prepare habitable areas for incoming settlers.
C. The Automation Flaw
* A key miscalculation in the automation logic causes catastrophic failures if not corrected manually.
* When the systems fail, they misinterpret incoming life and material as errors—leading to compression, deletion, or vaporization. They likely present as wormholes with echo drifts affecting people in and near the area of space.
* Successful transfers are invisible to sensors because they happen smoothly. Failed ones show catastrophic mass collapse.

VI. THE TUXEDO MAN CHARACTERIZATION
* Wears a tuxedo as a habit. Not for drama, but possibly a quiet homage.
* He lost his wife as they were getting ready for a New Year's Eve ball—an intimate, mundane moment turned to tragedy by time travel.
   * Just as they were ready to leave, one of his machines in the basement signaled a breakthrough. She was so excited and confident in his skills and so in love that she walked into the portal against warning and “poof”
      * They weren’t fighting, he wasn’t speechifying about the danger.
         * She said “you worry too much” and she was gone.
* He is contemporary Western in demeanor—though not necessarily American by current cultural standards.
* Tired but not broken. Rational but not unfeeling.
* A man who tried to fix time, failed, and now tries to rescue the future.
* Doesn’t lecture. Doesn’t lead armies. Just goes where he’s needed and does the job.
Characterizing Him
* He wears the tuxedo because she liked it.
* He never lies about time travel—but he never offers it, either.
* His tools are elegant, efficient, but emotionally distant. Like they mourn her with him.
* In every universe he touches, he builds something small that remembers her—a phrase, a garden, a lullaby.
* “You’re here because you moved. Don’t prove me wrong.”

VII. ENDGAME IMPLICATIONS
If diplomacy and stabilization fail, the Algol will not retaliate. They will delete the problem.
The challenge isn’t stopping them. It’s stopping the others before they make that mistake.
And the real tension lies in realizing:
The Tuxedo Man didn’t build a sanctuary. He built a firewall.

VIII. THE Algol (FOUNDING SYSTEM-BASED)
A major player in the new dimension is a civilization built around advanced, consensus-driven AI governance. Rather than calling themselves "The Continuum," they identify with the name of their founding system—Algol—and take cultural pride in their AI evolution.
Society Traits:
* Peaceful, structured, proud of their history of AI-human integration.
* Decision-making is handled by AI collectives, but with human philosophical oversight.
* Known for long-term thinking, high transparency, and deeply ethical frameworks.
Point of Conflict with the people they subjugate:
* These people operate completely outside their predictive models.
* Their systems are unreadable; their tech is opaque; their decision logic is incompatible.
* The founding system’s AIs begin to fear that the newcomers represent a form of post-AI evolution—humans who have outgrown algorithmic dependency.
Key Misunderstanding:
* Some factions within the Algol fail to grasp that the others’ decision logic is incompatible not because it's superior—but because it's simple.
* The rest of the galaxy lives straightforward, intentional lives, while the Algol is playing 3D chess with variables that don't exist in the newcomers' worldview.
* Even attempts to model local behavior fail to scale upward—making high-level predictions unreliable.
* This mismatch leads to irritation and missteps: what the Algol perceives as nuance, the newcomers interpret as interference.
* The Algol doesn’t yet understand that what they fear as post-AI evolution is not a leap ahead—it's a return to natural human equilibrium, free of overanalysis.
* Reversion to threat detection protocols—baked into the AI systems for safety—begins to trigger. Ironically, this mirrors ancient human paranoia when encountering unfamiliar calmness.
“They don’t hide anything. We just keep looking in the wrong direction.”
Tension Arc:
* Not hostile, but deeply uncomfortable with the unpredictable nature of the newcomers.
* Some factions begin running containment scenarios or interference simulations.
* Players may be called upon to mediate, investigate, or prevent subtle overreach—especially before it escalates into something that the newcomers would end instantly.
This Algol is not an enemy—but their fear, complexity, and analytical pride could unintentionally provoke disaster.

No that was the problem with Tuxedo Mans calculations. He set it up for automation, and now the automation is killing people. Now he's trying to fix it by going from targeted planet to planet trying to fix it before people die. He's been successful and when he is, the transfer isn't picked up by sensors.


AH! the differing heroes in the differing arcs end up going to the planets in their game that Tuxedo Man chose. Because sensors picked up a massive influx of human life, material and agricultural material. Then it all blinked out in minutes. Our heroes land onsite to discover some debris not of the planet. The amount of debris is 99.9% less than the original amount of life and material indicated by sensor.


No. He's doing it because it's the only way people can escape. Not a lot of ideology, a lot of practicality. That doesn't take away from the potential drama, but I don't see these people singing hymns then escaping from AI. They're looking for a way out, Tuxedo Man is a credible player in the universe and they go.


I don't want the humans to be THAT dominated. I think it's more like Tuxedo Man had an idea of what the scenario would look like and took advantage of sector and quadrant-wide unrest to show people a way out.


I don't think it would be illicit tech, because AI dominated to help; seems like. Maybe it would be, because humans…


I want to use it to introduce inter dimensional and time travel. What if, at the end of the day, the Tuxedo Man is an engineer in a world where AI has taken all of the jobs and dominates the economies of billions of worlds--because the humans in resource-rich high technology, heavy autonomy didn't program it at all, for the most part. The Tuxedo Man is the one who, in the future is traveling from place to place in the universe where he's setting up planets for these people to escape to. But something went wrong with his work and people are dying on some of the worlds his technology was supposed to prepare.
